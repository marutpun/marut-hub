# Guardian of the Cursed Lands

## Items

### Ancient Infernal Draconic Executioner's Sword

- ATK Power: 358
- Weapon Type: Sword
- Rarity: Legendary

This sword was made long ago in a fiery volcano. It was used by the Draconic Executioners, strong warriors who were trusted to defeat the most dangerous enemies. The blade is made from dragon bones and dark stone, making it incredibly strong. It is said that the sword was soaked in the blood of a powerful fire dragon, giving it extra power. The sword has been used in many battles and has a dark history. Those who see it or hear about it know it brings fear because of its power and the destruction it caused.

#### Skills

- **Infernal Fury**: Increases the user’s attack power by 30% for 10 seconds after landing a critical hit.
- **Draconic Rage**: Grants the user a 20% chance to deal double damage with each attack for 8 seconds.
- **Executioner's Strength**: Boosts the user’s damage against bosses and large enemies by 40% for 12 seconds.
- **Blaze of War**: Increases attack speed by 25% for 10 seconds after slaying an enemy, allowing for quicker follow-up strikes.

### Staff of the Lost Sovereigns

- ATK Power 0
- Weapon Type: Staff
- Rarity: None (GM only)

Once held by rulers of fallen kingdoms, this staff radiates a dark, mysterious aura. Many great kingdoms and empires once wielded it, but they have all crumbled, their rulers lost to time. The staff has seen countless wars and the death of many sovereigns, each leaving behind a legacy of ruin. Now, it rests in the forgotten corners of the world, its power untapped and its purpose unclear, waiting for the next soul to claim it.

#### Skills

- **Banishing Touch**: Selects a player to instantly drop from the game server, disconnecting them without warning
- **Regal Recall**: Forcibly sends a selected player to the town instantly, regardless of their current location or mission progress.
- **Exile of the Forsaken**: Sends a selected player to a forbidden sanctum as punishment.
- **Voice of the Fallen**: Forces all players to hear a haunting message or warning broadcast through the game's voice/chat system.

### Grimoire of the Wind Sanctum

- ATK Power 0
- Weapon Type: Book
- Rarity: None (GM only)

This ancient and ethereal spellbook was once the prized possession of the Wind Sanctum, a mysterious order of wizards who protected the arcane secrets of the skies. Its pages shimmer with the power of rejuvenation, calling forth the winds of life to revive fallen warriors at the very site of their demise.

Unlike the Staff of Lost Sovereigns, which serves as a punishment, the grimoire offers hope, guiding those who fight for the greater good back into the fray. It is a symbol of mercy and salvation, restoring strength when all seemed lost.

#### Skills

- **Tempest’s Wrath**: Temporarily increases the player's attack power by +500 for 10 seconds, empowering their strikes with the raw fury of a raging storm.
- **Breath of Eternity**: Restores 25% of the player’s total health instantly and continues to regenerate 5% health per second for 8 seconds, reviving them in the midst of chaos.
- **Guardian’s Gale**: Creates an impenetrable wind barrier around the player that absorbs up to 1000 damage, nullifying all incoming attacks for 8 seconds.
- **Eye of the Storm**: Grants the player an aura that increases all damage dealt by 50% and grants immunity to debuffs for 5 seconds, making them a whirlwind of destruction.

### Finger of Behemoth

- ATK Power 0
- Weapon Type: Staff
- Rarity: None (GM only)

The Finger of Behemoth was once the colossal limb of an ancient monster, a beast of unimaginable power that roamed the earth 10,000 years ago. Its body fell in battle, leaving only fragments of its giant form scattered across the lands. Three witch sisters, drawn to its immense dark energy, stole the severed finger and transformed it into a scepter of unimaginable magic. Through forbidden rituals and unholy rites, they imbued it with dark power, binding the monster's wrath into the scepter. Now, the Finger of Behemoth serves as a weapon of punishment, channeling the malevolent force of the ancient beast to smite those who dare to defy the wielder’s will.

#### Skills

- **Behemoth’s Grasp**: The ancient power of the Behemoth claws at the mind of the player. Their vision is consumed by an overwhelming darkness, trapping them in a suffocating void. [Vision -1000]
- **Abyssal Silence**: The curse silences the player, pulling them into a realm of eerie quiet. All sounds—be it the clash of battle, footsteps, or distant voices—vanish into nothingness. [In-game muted]
- **Behemoth’s Reversal**: The power of the Behemoth twists the very world around the player. [In-game screen rotate 180 degree]
- \*_Distorted Roar_: From the tomb of the Behemoth, a chilling, dissonant roar echoes, a sound born not of life but of decay. The beast’s restless soul, still angry over its ancient defeat, releases its fury through this haunting cry. The roar reverberates across the land, warping reality itself. Upon hearing it, the player’s world begins to twist—mouse movements are reversed, text is flipped from right to left, and the very fabric of the world reflects itself in a disorienting mirror. Even the alphabet becomes corrupted, turning familiar words into their reversed forms. For 10 seconds, players are trapped in a shattered multiverse, unable to trust what they see or do as the Behemoth’s dying rage distorts everything around them.
